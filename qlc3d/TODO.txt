10. Potential calculation is done even when not needed.
    Also, dont make a potential matrix when not needed.

7.  Integrate SparseLib so that the modified SparseLib class files are kept with qlc3d.

4.  Interpolation is simplified -> uniaxial interpolation. should
    interpolate each eigenvector/eigenvalue istead

============ DONE ==============================
11. Remove dependencies to Qt, it is annoying. Create own 'filesystem' class
    that deals with creating directories on different OSs. 
	07/11/2011 - done. filesystem functions in filesysfun.h and filesysfun.cpp
	
9.  Periodic boundaries in mesh refinement.
	05/06/2011 - done, but not fully tested.
	
8.  Periodic boundaries for a full box. Currently only periodic side boundaries exist.
    Add top/bottom periodic boundaries.
    03/06/2011 - done and seems to work.


5.  After autorefinement, the order at some nodes (in non-refined and refined regions)
    start to increase.
    - Seems not to happen when only a single refinement iteration is used.
    12/01/11 - Fixed (by the looks of it, anyways). Problem was in interpolation between meshes.
    In some cases element in source mesh that contained the new node was identified incorrectly
    as a non-LC element. This resulted in reading director/order param values from wrong memory
    locations. Checking for this was added and the program seems much happier.
    ...Actually problem was with not resizing potential vector -> junk potential data in new nodes.


6.  Make changes to SparseLib so that duplicate copies of all data is not made. This should speed things up
    a lot and allow for larger meshes to be ran on 32bit machines. Change by adding new constructor for
    double vector in "mvvd.h" and "mvvd.cpp".
    - Done, needs testing on win32 machine. Also, see #7.


3.  Surface normal calculation does not get normal always correct in
    all positionafter a refinement (test with droplet).
    09/01/11 - Works now. Surface normal was calculated correctly, but
    cal to setStrongSurfaces was missing.

2.  Interpolation of results between different meshes goes crazy sometimes, sometimes not.
    I.E. first ~3 refinements seem OK, then everything eplodes!
    08/12/10 - interpolation seems OK now, with simplifications (See #4).

1. WRITE NEW OUTPUT MESH FILE WHEN MESH HAS CHANGED AFTER MESH REFINEMENT
    07/12/10 - SEEMS TO BE WORKING NOW.
